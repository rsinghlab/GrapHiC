'''
    This file contains all the scripts used to read the node encoding files
    Implementation is under progress: 
    Will add support to read:
        1) ATAC signal,
        2) DNAse signal 
        3) CTFC signal
        4) H3K4Me1
        5) H3K4Me3
        6) H3K27ac
        7) H3K27Me3
        
    In its fully implemented form we should have a wrapper function that reads all 
    the provided epigentic signal files and read them and return them in a form that is agreeable 
    with the node encoding representation
